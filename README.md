# Hello, I'm VINOTH MURUGAN 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **DevOps Engineer** with a strong focus on **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **containerization**. I specialize in automating and optimizing infrastructure management using tools like **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **Docker**. My goal is to help organizations achieve efficient, scalable, and reliable cloud infrastructure.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about leveraging **IaC** practices to streamline cloud infrastructure management and automate the entire software delivery lifecycle. With hands-on experience in **Docker** and container orchestration, I focus on making infrastructure deployments repeatable and scalable while reducing human errors.

🔧 **Tools & Technologies I Use**:
- **IaC Tools**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Helm
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Scripting**: Python, Shell scripting
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab

## 🛠️ My Current Focus

I’m currently working on:
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automating cloud infrastructure provisioning and management with Terraform and CloudFormation.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Managing and deploying containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Building and maintaining automated pipelines for faster, more reliable deployments.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

I’m always eager to learn and improve. Currently, I’m exploring:
- **Advanced Terraform** for multi-cloud environments.
- **Serverless technologies** and how to integrate them into IaC workflows.
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration and scaling containerized workloads.

## 💡 Why Infrastructure as Code?

IaC is the future of cloud infrastructure. It enables consistent, repeatable, and automated management of environments. With IaC, I’m able to provision cloud resources, configure services, and manage deployments in a way that’s scalable, auditable, and easy to maintain.

Thanks for visiting my profile! Let's make cloud infrastructure easier to manage and deploy! 🚀
